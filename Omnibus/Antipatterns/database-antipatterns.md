# Database anti-patterns

## Using `VARCHAR` instead of `TEXT` (PostgreSQL)

Unless you absolutely restrict the width of a text column for data
consistency reason, don't do it.

This
[benchmark](http://www.depesz.com/2010/03/02/charx-vs-varcharx-vs-varchar-vs-text/)
shows that there's fundamentally no difference in performance between
`char(n)`, `varchar(n)`, `varchar` and `text`. Here's why you should
pick `text`:

- `char(n)`: takes more space than necessary when dealing with values
  shorter than n.
- `varchar(n)`: it's difficult to change the width.
- `varchar` is just like `text`.
- `text` does not have the width problem that `char(n)` and `varchar(n)`
  and has a cleaner name than `varchar`.
