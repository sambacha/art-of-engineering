## The purpose of software project management

[source](https://blog.locut.us/2016/01/03/the-purpose-of-software-project-management/)

I recently read the article The sad graph of software death by Gregory
Brown.

Brown describes a software project wherein tasks are being opened faster
than they are being closed in the project‚Äôs task tracker. The author
describes this as ‚Äúbroken‚Äù, ‚Äúsad‚Äù, and ‚Äúwasteful.‚Äù The assumption behind
the article seems to be that there is something inherently bad about
tasks being opened faster than they are being closed.

The author doesn‚Äôt explain why this is bad, and to me this article and
the confused discussion it prompted on Reddit are symptomatic of the
fact that most people don‚Äôt have a clear idea of the purpose of software
project management.

Another symptom is that so many software projects run into problems,
causing tension between engineering, product, and other parts of the
company. It is also the reason there is such a proliferation of tools
that purport to help solve the problem of project management, but none
of them do because they don‚Äôt start from a clear view of what exactly
this problem is.

### Two complimentary goals

In my view, the two core goals of project management are prioritization
and predictability.

Prioritization ensures that at any given time, the project‚Äôs developers
are working on the tasks with the highest ratio of value to effort

Predictability means accurately estimating what will get done and by
when, and communicating that with the rest of the company.

A task tracker maintains a record of who is currently working on
specific tasks, which tasks are completed, and the future tasks that
could be tackled. As such, the trackers do not address the two core
goals of project management directly.

I have actually thought about building a project management tool that
addresses these goals, i.e. prioritization and predictability, much more
directly than is currently the case with existing systems.
Unfortunately, to date the value to effort ratio hasn‚Äôt been high enough
relative to other projects üôÇ

When a task is created or ‚Äúopened‚Äù in a task tracker, this simply means
‚Äúhere is something we may want to do at some point in the future.‚Äù

Opening a task isn‚Äôt, or shouldn‚Äôt be, an assertion that it must get
done, or must get done by a specific time. Although this might imply
that some tasks may never be finished, that‚Äôs ok. Besides, a row in a
modern database table is very cheap indeed.

Therefore, the faster rate at which tasks are opened rather than closed
is not an indication of a project‚Äôs impending demise; rather, it merely
reflects the normal tendency of people to think of new tasks for the
project faster than developers are able to complete those tasks.

Once created, tasks should then go through a prioritization or triage
process; however, the output isn‚Äôt simply ‚Äúyes, we‚Äôll do it‚Äù or ‚Äúno, we
won‚Äôt.‚Äù Rather, the output should be an estimate of the value provided
to complete the task, as well as an estimate of the effort or resources
required to complete it. Based on these two estimates, we can calculate
the value/effort for the tasks. It is only then that we can stack-rank
the tasks.

### Estimating value and effort

Of course, this makes it sound much simpler than it is. Accurately
estimating the value of a task is a difficult process that may require
input from sales, product, marketing, and many other parts of a
business. Similarly, accurately estimating the effort required to
complete a task can be challenging for even the most experienced
engineer.

There are processes designed to help with these estimates. Most of these
processes, such as planning poker, rely on the wisdom of crowds. These
are steps toward the right direction.

I believe the ultimate solution to estimation will exploit the fact that
people are much better at making relative, rather than absolute,
estimates. For example, it is easier to guess that an elephant is 4
times heavier than a horse, than to estimate that the absolute weight of
an elephant is 8000 pounds.

This was recently supported by a simple experiment that I conducted.
First, I asked a group to individually assign a number of these relative
or comparative estimates. Then, I used a constraint solver to turn these
into absolute estimates. The preliminary results are very promising.
This approach would almost certainly be part of any project management
tool that I might build.

Once we have good estimates for value/effort, we can then prioritize the
tasks. Using our effort estimate, combined with an understanding of the
resources available, we can come up with better time estimates. This
will enhance predictability that can be shared with the rest of the
company.

### Pivotal Tracker

I have had quite a bit of experience with Pivotal Tracker, which I would
describe as the ‚Äúleast bad‚Äù project management tool. Pivotal Tracker
doesn‚Äôt solve the prioritization problem, but it does attempt to help
with the predictability problem. Unfortunately, it does so in a way that
is so simplistic as to make it almost useless. Let me explain.

Pivotal Tracker assumes that for each task, you have assigned effort
estimates which are in the form of ‚Äúpoints‚Äù (you are responsible for
defining what a point means). It also assumes that you have correctly
prioritized the tasks, which are then placed in the ‚Äúbacklog‚Äù in
priority order.

Pivotal Tracker then monitors how many points are ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù within a
given time period. It then uses these points to project when future
tasks will be completed.

The key problem with this tool is that it pretends that the backlog is
static, i.e. that new tasks won‚Äôt be added to the backlog before tasks
are prioritized. In reality, tasks are constantly being added to any
active project, and these new tasks might go straight to the top of the
priority list.

Nevertheless, the good news is that Pivotal Tracker could probably be
improved to account for this addition of new tasks without much
difficulty. Perhaps a third party could make these improvements by using
the Java library I created for integrating with PT‚Äôs API. üôÇ

### Breaking down tasks

Most tasks start out as being quite large, and need to be broken down
into smaller tasks, both to make it easier to divide tasks among
developers, but also to improve the accuracy of estimates.

However, there isn‚Äôt much point in breaking down tasks when nobody is
going to start work on them for weeks or months. For this reason, I
advise setting time-horizon limits for task sizes. For example, you
might say that a task that is estimated to be started within three
months can‚Äôt be larger than 2 man-weeks, and a task to be started within
1 month cannot be larger than 4 man-days.

As a task crosses each successive time-horizon, it may need to be broken
into smaller tasks (each of which will, presumably, be small enough
until they hit the next time horizon). In practice this can be
accomplished with a weekly meeting, that can be cancelled if there are
no tasks to be broken down. We would assign one developer to break down
each oversized task and then the meeting would break up so that they
could go and do that. Typically each large task would be broken down
into 3-5 smaller tasks.

This approach has the additional advantage that it spreads out the
process of breaking down tasks over time and among developers.

Resource allocation

So how do you decide who works on what? This is fairly simple under this
approach. Developers simply pick the highest priority task that they can
work on (depending on skill set or interdependencies).

At OneSpot, when we broke down tasks, we left the subtasks in the same
position in the priority stack as the larger task they replaced. Since
developers pull new tasks off the top of the priority list, this has the
tendency to encourage as many people as possible to be working on
related tasks at any given time, which minimizes the number of projects
(large tasks) in-flight at any given time.

### Conclusion

To conclude, without a clear view of the purpose of successful project
management, it is not surprising that so many projects flounder with
many project management tools failing to hit the mark. I hope I was able
to provide the beginnings of a framework to think about project
management in a goal-driven way.
