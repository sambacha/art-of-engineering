# SQLAlchemy Anti-Patterns

This is a list of what I consider
[SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) anti-patterns.

## Abusing lazily loaded relationships

Bad:

```python
class Customer(Base):

    @property
    def has_valid_toast(self):
        """Return True if customer has at least one valid toast."""
        return any(toast.kind == 'brioche' for toast in self.toaster.toasts)
```

This suffers from severe performance inefficiencies:

- The toaster will be loaded, as well as its toast. This involves
  creating and issuing the SQL query, waiting for the database to
  return, and instantiating all those objects.
- `has_valid_toast` does not actually care about those objects. It just
  returns a boolean.

A better way would be to issue a SQL `EXISTS` query so that the database
handles this check and only returns a boolean.

Good:

```python
class Customer(Base):

    @property
    def has_valid_toast(self):
        """Return True if customer has at least one valid toast."""
        query = (session.query(Toaster)
                 .join(Toast)
                 .with_parent(self)
                 .filter(Toast.kind == 'brioche'))
        return session.query(query.exists()).scalar()
```

This query might not always be the fastest if those relationships are
small, and eagerly loaded.

## Explicit session passing

TODO

Bad:

```python
def toaster_exists(toaster_id, session):
    ...
```

## Implicit transaction handling

TODO

## Loading the full object when checking for object existence

Bad:

```python
def toaster_exists(toaster_id):
    return bool(session.query(Toaster).filter_by(id=toaster_id).first())
```

This is inefficient because it:

- Queries all the columns from the database (including any eagerly
  loaded joins)
- Instantiates and maps all data on the Toaster model

The database query would look something like this. You can see that all
columns are selected to be loaded by the ORM.

```sql
SELECT toasters.id AS toasters_id, toasters.name AS toasters_name,
toasters.color AS toasters_color
FROM toasters
WHERE toasters.id = 1
 LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0
```

And then it just checks if the result is truthy.

Here's a better way to do it:

```python
def toaster_exists(toaster_id):
    query = session.query(Toaster).filter_by(id=toaster_id)
    return session.query(query.exists()).scalar()
```

In this case, we just ask the database about whether a record exists
with this id. This is obviously much more efficient.

```sql
SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1
FROM toasters
WHERE toasters.id = 1) AS anon_1
```

## Using identity as comparator

Bad:

```python
toasters = session.query(Toaster).filter(Toaster.deleted_at is None).all()
```

Unfortunately this won't work at all. This query will return all
toasters, including the one that were deleted.

The way sqlalchemy works is that it overrides the magic comparison
methods (`__eq__`, `__lt__`, etc.). All comparison methods can be
overrode except the identity operator (`is`) which checks for objects
identity.

What this means is that expression `Toaster.deleted_at is None` will be
immediately evaluated by the Python interpreter, and since (presumably)
`Toaster.deleted_at` is a
`sqlalchemy.orm.attributes.InstrumentedAttribute`, it's not `None` and
thus it's equivalent to doing:

```python
toasters = session.query(Toaster).filter(True).all()
```

Which obviously renders the filter inoperable, and will return all
records.

There's two ways to fix it:

```python
toasters = session.query(Toaster).filter(Toaster.deleted_at == None).all()
```

Here we use the equality operator, which Python allows overriding.
Behind the scene, Python calls `Toaster.deleted_at.__eq__(None)`, which
gives SQLAlchemy the opportunity to return a comparator that when
coerced to a string, will evaluate to `deleted_at is NULL`.

Most linter will issue a warning for equality comparison against `None`,
so you can also do (this is my preferred solution):

```python
toasters = session.query(Toaster).filter(Toaster.deleted_at.is_(None)).all()
```

See docs for
[is\_](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/core/sqlelement.html#sqlalchemy.sql.operators.ColumnOperators.is_).

## Returning `None` instead of raising a `NoResultFound` exception

See
[Returning nothing instead of raising NotFound exception](https://github.com/charlax/antipatterns/blob/master/code-antipatterns.md#returning-nothing-instead-of-raising-notfound-exception).
